# Native workspace parity

Target: the existing live Track.app workspace, not just the snapshot prototype.
The Go engine remains authoritative. Static-site generation and encrypted publishing
remain existing CLI/web capabilities; displaying embedded apps is still a desktop requirement.

Implementation and validation are separate gates. An unchecked cell is not a claim
of support. Use disposable fixture vaults, never a configured personal vault, for tests.

completed row, record the fixture/test and native QA result in the corresponding PR.
Native text, selection and virtualized scrolling were verified on Apple Silicon /
macOS 27.2 after explicitly enabling `font-kit`. Full accessibility and IME parity
remain open; the original missing glyphs were a disabled font backend, not an OS fault.

## Reuse the engine boundary

- The initial read-only adapter executes explicit CLI commands on background workers;
  it is a transitional integration, not the editing/source contract.
- Use the existing HTTP API for live interaction; keep filesystem parsing, indexing,
  link resolution, metadata serialization and writes in Go. Snapshot import remains
  useful for isolated rendering tests, not as the live architecture.
- Read endpoints: `/api/vaults`, `/api/search`, `/api/notes`, `/api/note`,
  `/api/note/meta`, `/api/hierarchy`, `/api/resolve`, `/api/activity`.
- Mutation and planning endpoints: `/api/note`, `/api/note/meta`, `/api/asset`,
  `/api/tasks`, `/api/task`, `/api/agenda`, `/api/journal`, `/api/calendar-events`,
  `/api/calendar-event`.
- Rendering/interaction endpoints: `/api/render`, `/api/viewspec`,
  `/api/metrics-dashboard`, `/api/ogp`, `/api/graph`, `/api/graph/local`,
  `/api/follow`, `/api/markdown`, `/api/markdown/consume`, `/api/events`.
- **`/api/render` returns Markdown and resolved include/fence information, not HTML.**
  Native rendering still needs implementations of the web renderer's formats.
  Decide native rendering versus an isolated web surface per format; embedding the
  entire existing workspace is not proof of native feature parity.
- Treat note identifiers as opaque and scope them by vault. Preserve partial-read,
  unavailable-vault and stale-cache information rather than presenting an empty result.
- Keep HTTP and parsing off the UI thread. Reject stale responses after navigation
  or search changes. Reconnect SSE by refreshing affected data: missed events are
  not replayed. Existing events distinguish `change` from `data`.

## Safety gates

- [ ] Save with the server-provided `etag`; test conflicting external edits and keep
  the unsaved draft on failure. Send typed metadata fields rather than assembling YAML.
- [ ] Verify save/discard/cancel behavior for tab close, navigation, reload, restart,
  window close and application quit. Do not silently replace drafts after refresh.
- [ ] Own the Go child explicitly. Preserve the desktop parent PID/readiness-token
  protocol, wait for `TRACK_DESKTOP_READY:<token>` plus health, and reject port
  collisions. Never adopt or terminate a process merely because it owns a port/name.
- [ ] Stop only the owned child, with bounded escalation and verified reaping,
  including stopped or unresponsive children.
- [ ] Preserve workspace/static-app origin isolation. External links require an
  explicit user gesture; unsupported schemes and unrelated loopback embeds stay blocked.
- [ ] Check native text, Japanese IME composition, selection, clipboard, focus and
  accessibility before treating the editor as a replacement.
- [ ] Exercise malformed input, empty data, unavailable storage, partial reads,
  network interruption and reconnect without data loss or misleading success states.

## Delivery stages

1. **Rendering baseline:** fix font setup, test English/Japanese/emoji, selection,
   scrolling and resizing. Add a repeatable native smoke fixture.
2. **Live read-only slice:** explicit disposable vault → owned Go server → vault
   list/search → note body/backlinks. Validate request cancellation and partial states.
3. **Safe editing slice:** input → save → etag update → reload, plus concurrent edits,
   disconnected saves and all dirty-close paths. Add create/metadata/assets next.
4. **Reading workspace:** basic Markdown, links/includes, tabs, history, reading
   position and find. Track unsupported rich formats visibly rather than dropping them.
5. **Planning and visualization:** tasks, calendar/journals/events and graph interaction;
   then rich diagrams, charts and media with explicit sandbox boundaries.
6. **Native completion:** menus, shortcuts, notifications, speech, handoff, packaging
   and lifecycle behavior. Resolve remaining checklist gaps before replacement claims.

## Evidence required for completion

- Run the same disposable scenarios against Track.app and GPUI; compare navigation,
  visible content, saved bodies/sidecars, conflicts, recovery and shutdown outcomes.
- Reuse `docs/testing/desktop-clean-termination.md`, `desktop-editor-recovery.md`,
  `desktop-restart.md`, desktop smoke tests and existing web/Go regression fixtures.
- Record release-build frame time, memory and input latency for equal note counts,
  document content and window sizes. Continuous scroll, selection, resize and long-note
  editing are separate workloads. A virtualized list alone proves no editor speedup.
- Keep normal Track.app working throughout the migration. Publish coherent increments
  with explicit missing/unverified features; do not mark parity complete on compilation alone.
